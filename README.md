### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Alexander Mironov, I'm **Backend Developer** :octocat: from Russia 
*(and it actually means English is not my primary language, so there might be mistakes, ~~mistakes everywhere~~)*

According to my humble GitHub statistics you can see - my journey in developing had just begun in november 2021 - yeah, I'm just a beginner developer *(hope when upgrade my hard skills - I will not forget update this text :eyes:)*.

### Stack
My primary language is **PHP**:rocket:. But at the same time I'm trying to learn JS ~~(thinking to be Full-stack, haha)~~. Will learn Laravel framework:books: as fast as possible and it will become my main framework.\
Summing up, my basic stack is:\
**PHP (Laravel) -- JS (JQuery) -- MySQL**

### About
Don't know what I really may to white - in my free from developing time && if it posible - like rollerblading. But the most favourite hobby is PC gaming:video_game:.\
The most lovely genre - action RPG and specifically game series Dark Souls :skull:
